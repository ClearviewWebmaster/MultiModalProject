				<h1>What is Notepad ++</h1>
				<p>Notepad++ is a free text editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. So basically it takes the default windows notepad program and completely overhauls it. Unlike the regular notepad where you can only open a limited number of file types and when it does open them it most of the time displays them as a jumbled mess. Notepad++ opens many different files types and displays them in a nice and customizable way. Notepad ++ comes with many help features, like the ability to have multiple tabs open in one menu, the ability to make record and save custom macros, and many more (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/features/" target="_blank"  style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">Find Out More</a>). On top of these features you also have the ability to install plugins so if there is missing feature or language you want you can most likely find a plugin that adds it in.<p>

Once your there look under Download 64bit  and click "Notepad++ Installer 64-bit" to download the 64bit version. If you just want the 32-bit version you can just click the big green download button.</p>

			<div id="textBox" class="right">
				<h1>Step 4</h1>
				<img src=3.png>
				<p>Now you can decide what components you want to install along with it. By default it it selects all of them, which I also suggest because they don't take up much space, but you can choose what you want. </p>

				<h1>You're done!</h1>
				<img src=4.png style="height:auto; width:50%;">
				<p>And with that you have successfully installed notepad++ and should have something similar to this.

			<h2>Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<section id="box">
			<div id="full">
				<p>Now that you have it installed you can go to Setting-> Style Configurator and choose a different color theme if you wish. You can also create a custom theme and make it look however you want. I also suggest going to Setting-> Preferences -> auto-complete and turn on any of the auto-complete. Another place to check out in setting is the short cut mapper. this is where you can see and change around all of the keyboard commands that can be done and edit any macros you make.</p></p>
				<img src=6.png style="height:auto; width:30%;">
				<p>Along the top they give you controls to toggle world warp, which just makes it so text stays on screen instead of running off to infinity, show all characters, define your own language, see a map of your document, see what function you have in a program ,set your folder as a workspace, and record, save,and run custom macros.</p>
